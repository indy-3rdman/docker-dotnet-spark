## Description

This repository contains the source code to build a variety of different docker images related to [.NET for Apache Spark](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/data/spark).

You can also get the pre-built images directly from the the docker hub at [https://hub.docker.com/r/3rdman/dotnet-spark](https://hub.docker.com/r/3rdman/dotnet-spark).

Currently, there are three different image types.

- [runtime](images/runtime/README.md)

   The runtime images contain everything you need to test your .NET for Apache Spark application, without the need to install all the required bits manually.

- [dev](images/dev/README.md)

  Use these images, if you want to build .NET for Apache Spark yourself.

- [interactive](images/interactive/README.md)

  Lets you play around with .NET for Apache Spark in an Interactive Notebook.
